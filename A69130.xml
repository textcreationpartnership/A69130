         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16458:3"/> 
               <hi>Prou. 18. 24. Which ſpeech beeing oft recalled, was the occaſion of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, and impulſiue cauſe of the dedication of theſe Sermons to all your moſt reſpected worthineſſe. The moſt deſeruing cauſe I confeſſe, was the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of wonted bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, and your annuall beneficence, whereof theſe few yeeres I haue been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker. So that,</hi> Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio beneficij, <hi>became</hi> Commendacio officij, <hi>to mee,</hi> .i. <hi>The remembrance of your vndeſerued bounty, was a commending and commanding of this my moſt deſerued duety. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, in regard of God, is to ſeeke his glory, in the good of his Church; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16458:3"/> 
               <hi>of you; to teſtifie my thankfulnes for your choice of mee among ſome other of my fellow labourers, in this caſe; And as hee that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the benefits of God or men, cannot but bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull to both; ſo on the contrary,</hi> Qui quanta ſibi gratia collata ſit, neſcit, quantas largitori grates debet, non intelligit .i. <hi>Hee that knowes not what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour is beſtowed vpon him, vnderstands not what thankes hee oweth to him that gaue it. And the more deſerued praiſe belongs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, becauſe yours is a vitall, not a funerall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence: Concerning which, it is well of ſome obſerued, that beeing vitall, it is free, and ſuch as God accounts</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16458:4"/> 
               <hi>of; it ſhewes, firſt, your faith in Gods prouidence; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, your loue and care to doe good to Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; Thirdly, that you trust not in vncertaine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; Fourthly, it gaines you the prayers of thoſe to whom you are beneficiall; whereas a funerall benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, is moſt commonly formall, for faſhion, to doe as others doe; or extorted to the hazzard of their goods, or for vaine-glory, or to ſtoppe the mouth of an accuſing conſcience. Now becauſe I could no way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſſe my thankefull heart, nor knew, hauing ſo many friends, how to ſhew my ſelfe more friendly, I haue preſumed to make an exchange; for your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16458:4"/> 
               <hi>to beſtow amongſt you all, this ſpiritual gift; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt requitall I can make, or cotent that I could giue. I acknowledge my ſelfe much obliged to you, though vnknowne to moſt of you; I praiſe you in God, and bleſſe God for you all; and though I cannot ſay, I am yours to liue and die with you, yet by Gods grace I ſhall euer bee yours to liue and pray for you; that I may vſe the words of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel; As for me, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you; but I wil teach you the good &amp; the right way; Onely feare the Lord, and ſerue him in truth with all your heart, for conſider how great things, hee hath
<pb facs="tcp:16458:5"/> done for you, <hi>1. Sam. 12, 23, 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now giue me leaue, I beſeech you, to ſpeake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you all, as</hi> Paul <hi>did to the Corinthians,</hi> My mouth is open vnto you, my heart is enlarged; Now for a recompenſe in the ſame, be ye alſo enlarged, <hi>2. Cor. 6. 11, 13. Let your good workes be continued;</hi> And bee not weary in well doing, for in due ſeaſon ye ſhall reape, if yee faint not, <hi>Gal. 6. 9. It is conſtancie in well-doing, that crowns the worke;</hi> In caſſum, bonum quid agitur, ſi ante vite terminum, deſeratur. i. <hi>It is in vaine to doe any good thing, and to leaue off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death; as,</hi> Non coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſe, ſed perfeciſſe virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
<pb facs="tcp:16458:5"/> eſt, <hi>ſaith</hi> Ierome, .i. <hi>It is the property of vertue, not to begin well, but to end well. Let your good workes be plentiful and abundant;</hi> More at laſt, than at firſt, <hi>Reuel. 2. 19. Yea, ſometime ſuperabundant; like the Macedonians, who</hi> to their power, yea, and beyond their power were willing of themſelues, &amp;c. <hi>2. Cor. 8. 3. Let all be done diſcreetly;</hi> making much of them that feare the Lord, <hi>Pſal. 15. 4.</hi> Diſtributing to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Saints, <hi>Rom. 12. 13.</hi> doing good to all, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially to thoſe which are of the houſhold of faith, <hi>Gal. 6. 10. ſo regarding, and rewarding moſt plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe that labour paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in Gods harueſi. Thus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16458:6"/> 
               <hi>let good doing be cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not grudgingly, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, but willingly,</hi> for God loues a chearefull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, 2 Cor. 9. 7. if there be firſt a willing minde, God accepts it, 2 Cor. 8. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to ſtirre you vp the more, remember I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you what</hi> Salomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> He that pittieth the poore, lends vnto the Lord, and what hee hath giuen him, will he pay him againe, Prou. 19. 17. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith;</hi> To doe good, and to communicate, forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well-pleaſed, Heb. 13. 16. <hi>Remember what our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith;</hi> Hee that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet,
<pb facs="tcp:16458:6"/> ſhall receiue a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Math. 21. 22. <hi>God will reward you here and hereafter; Hee will reward you,</hi> 1 Donando, <hi>by giuing you all neceſſary good;</hi> 2 Condonando, <hi>by forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you all your ſinnes;</hi> 3 Coronando, <hi>by crowning you with euerlaſting life.

God will bee with you.</hi> 1 Detegendo, <hi>by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering the plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of your enemies.</hi> 2 Protegendo, <hi>by defending you againſt all dangers at home and abroad, both by ſea and land. Thus,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:16458:7"/> Lord is with you, while ye be with him, no longer, 2 Chron. 15. 2. And if you become like <hi>Dauids</hi> bleſſed man, whatſoeuer you doe it ſhall proſper, Pſal. 1. 1. 2. 3. If you ſhall meditate in the law of God day and night, and obſerue to doe what is written therein, then ſhall you make your way proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and then you ſhall haue good ſucceſſe, Ioſhua 1. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now giue mee leaue, I humbly beſeech you, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance my ſpeech a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you all; you encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the mighty bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of the great Sea; you indanger your ſelues, and yours, both in body and goods; In the middeſt of life,</hi>

               <hi>they are in death; If it pleaſe God to honour you in a ſtrange Land, with the treaſures of it, and to giue ſafe returne home, then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to honour God in your owne Country, with that which he hath lent you.</hi> So you honouring God, hee will ſtill honour you, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <hi>If aduerſity comes, be humble; if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, bee thankefull; if death it ſelfe, be patient. I would not haue you</hi> timidi, <hi>nor</hi> tumidi; <hi>neither ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much timerous, as doubting of Gods fauour, deſpairing of his loue, or diſtruſting his prouidence; nor too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, relying on your owne meanes, truſting to your owne merits, and ſo to ſacrifice to your owne nets,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16458:8"/> Habak. 1. 16. <hi>for the firſt, remember,</hi> He that keepeth Iſrael, ſhal neither ſlumber nor ſleepe, Pſal. 121. 4. <hi>for the latter, know,</hi> it is Gods bleſſing which maketh rich, Pro. 10 22.

In which place, are ſet downe two infallible notes of all Gods children, putting a maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked impes of Sathan. Firſt, <hi>Gods Children doe no iniquity.</hi> Which words muſt not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and properly bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for all men haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and doe ſinne, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after conuerſion. <hi>If I Iohn, and my fellow Apoſtles ſay we haue not ſinned, we make God a lyar, 1 Ioh. 1. 10.

For all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe are as filthy ragges, Eſay. 64. 6. For there is not a iuſt man vpon earth that doth good, and ſinneth not, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 20. It is not ſo meant then, that Gods
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16458:11"/> children neuer ſinne; neither, as the Papiſts hold, that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is ſo aboliſhed by Baptiſme, that, in the partie baptized, there remaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which God may hate; But the meaning of the words is this: <hi>They doe no iniquity;</hi> that is, they commit not ſinne ſo, as to liue in a cuſtomarie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of any one ſinne; though they may faile in words, and doe amiſſe in deedes, yet the tenour and courſe of their liues ſhall be according to Gods commandements. They lye not in their ſinnes; ſinne raignes not in them; they giue not themſelues ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, to become ſlaues and ſeruants vnto ſinne; They ſinne not againſt conſcience, and knowledge, of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they ſinne not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wilfully and wittingly, with full conſent and ſwinge of will: Neither can they ſo ſin,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16458:12"/> for being regenerated, the Spirit of God keeps them from ſo ſinning: Thus are the like places to be vnderſtood. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer abideth in Chriſt, ſinneth not, 1 Ioh. 3. 6. Whoſoeuer is borne of God, doth not commit ſinne, for his ſeede remaineth in him, and he cannot ſinne becauſe he is borne of God, verſe</hi> 9. This is a ſpeciall marke to diſcerne the childe of God, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; for the wicked ſinneth wilfully, cuſtomarily, lying, and trading in his ſinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſound repentance, or true remorſe of conſcience, ſporting and delighting in ſinne; <hi>going on in ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, Pſal. 68. hating to be reformed, Pſal. 50. he giueth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe to ſiane, to obey it in the luſts thereof, Rom.</hi> 6. In a word, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked being paſt feeling, giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to laſciuiouſneſſe, to</hi>

               <hi>worke all vncleaneneſſe with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, Epheſ. 4. 19. and not onely commit wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deedes, but commit them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily, in an vngodly manner, as Iude, Epiſt. Verſe</hi> 15. that is, they doe their workes from an vnrepentant heart, and with a minde deuoted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to vngodlineſſe; with a purpoſe to ſinne afore-hand; taking pleaſure in ſinne; and running on in the ſame courſe without repentance. Herein ſtands the ſound triall of a mans ſelfe indeede, whether he be in the ſtate of grace or not; namely, if hee can ſay truely in the teſtimony of a good conſcience, he doth no iniquity, ſo, as I haue ſhewed; Firſt, he purpoſeth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, but it is both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and againſt his purpoſe. Secondly, he hath a reſiſting and ſtrife againſt it, and is not wholly ſwallowed vp in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16458:13"/> pleaſure of it. Thirdly, if hee doth fall, through weakeneſſe and his owne corruption, yet he lieth not in it, but recouers himſelfe againe by renewed repentance. And this is the firſt marke of <hi>Dauids</hi> bleſſed man in the Text; and worthily are they ſet in the firſt place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a maine preparatiue to this walke; for firſt a man muſt ceaſe to doe euill, and then doe good; firſt, ceaſe to doe iniquitie, then to walke in Gods waies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>the godly walke in Gods waies.</hi> Firſt, obſerue their action; <hi>they walke,</hi> that is, they frame and leade their liues according to thoſe waies which God in his holy word hath appointed to walke in. Secondly, wherin they walke, and their diſcretion; not in their owne waies, following the imaginations of their own hearts; not in the waies of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16458:13"/> ſinne the world, the fleſh, nor Diuell; but denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and reſigning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wholly to Gods will and pleaſure in all things, <hi>they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abhorre all falſe wayes, Pſal. 119. 104. 128. they walke,</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>in his waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, marke the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their walke; not in ſome few; here and there do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome good thing in a good moode, or by fits and ſnatches, but yeelding a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obedience to all Gods Commandements, as <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth; They walke in all his waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, obſerue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who onely doe and can walke in this way; <hi>they;</hi> that is, onely the godly, who are indued with ſauing-grace, and haue ceaſed to commit iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they walke in his waies; they ſtand not ſtill in this way, nor goe backward, nor onely

This is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the godly and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>The godly walke in the law of the Lord, Pſal. 119. 1. Hee that is a iuſt and righteous man indeed, walketh in Gods ſtatutes, Ezech.</hi> 18. 9. and as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith here, <hi>they walke in Gods waies.</hi> But the wicked, not ſo. <hi>For they walke not in Gods law, nor in his ſtatutes, nor in his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:16458:14"/> 
               <hi>Ier. 44 23. They ſet themſelues in no good way, Pſal. 36. 4. The way of peace, they haue not knowne, Rom. 3. 17. They doe alwaies erre in their hearts, becauſe they haue not knowne Gods waies, Heb. 3. 10. They walke in the vanity of their minde, Epheſ. 4. 17. They walke after their owne vngodly luſts,</hi> as <hi>Iude, Epiſt. Verſe 16. 18. Yea, they walke, but they are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, Phil. 3. 18. They walke in the counſell of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. Pſal. 1. 1. The godly walke as children of the light, Epheſ. 5. 8. But the way of the wicked, is as the darkeneſſe, they know not at what they ſtumble, Prou. 4. 19. The wicked walke on in darkeneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 82. 4. All which muſt teach euery one to auoid the path of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the godly, to hate euery falſe way, and to keepe our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16458:15"/> ſelues onely in Gods waies. Thus may wee expect the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious protection and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God and his holy Angels, <hi>If we keepe our ſelues in thoſe waies he hath appointed for vs, Pſal. 91. 11. Be not therefore companions with the wicked, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 5. 7. Walke not thou in the way with them, refrayne thy foote from their path, Prouerb. 1. 15. For, for ſuch wicked courſes comes the wrath of God vpon the children of diſobedience, Epheſ. 5. 6.

They leaue the pathes of vprightneſſe, to walke in the wayes of darkeneſſe; They reioyce to doe euill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the frowardneſſe of the wicked, whoſe waies are crooked, and they froward in their pathes, Prou. 2. 13. 14. 15.

Then ſhalt thou walke in thy way ſafely, Prou. 3. 23. For the righteous walke in Gods waies,</hi> as the Text ſaith, <hi>They walke in his waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, obſerue out of this clauſe: firſt, what is meant by <hi>walke,</hi> and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes of it: ſecondly, what are theſe waies of God, and why ſo called.</p>
            <p>This dutie of walking is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a good ſence, or bad; In a good ſence, as here, and infinite like places both in the old and new Teſtament; In an euill ſence, as to walke in ſinne, in darkeneſſe, &amp;c. both which I haue ſhewed at large; From both acceptations, it is more than manifeſt; that, <hi>to walke,</hi> ſignifieth, to leade our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16458:16"/> liues orderly, warily, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, and to haue our conuerſation euery way ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe waies which God hath ſet downe in his word, neither declining to the right hand, nor to the left; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of <hi>Salomon: Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the path of thy feete, and let all thy waies be eſtabliſhed, Turne not to the right hand, nor to the left, Prou.</hi> 4. 26. 27. and to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Make ſtreight ſteppes for your feete, leſt that which is lam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be turned out of the way, Heb. 12. 13. And, take heed that yee walke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 15. Thus, to walke, is to liue thus and thus; to leade our liues in this and that; to order our liues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this and that, taking the word of God for our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule, to the obedience wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our whole liues are framed, and by which, all our actions towards God &amp; man, through
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16458:16"/> the whole courſe of our liues are ordered and ſquared. This is to walke in Gods wayes; which may well be explained by the ſaying of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalme: <hi>To him that ordereth his conuerſation aright, will I ſhew the ſaluation of God, Pſal.</hi> 50. 23. making the walking in Gods waies, and the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our conuerſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, all one in effect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of this word, <hi>Walke,</hi> in the bad ſence, ſaith, that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> walking in ſinne, was liuing in ſinne; <hi>in which, ye alſo walked ſometime, when ye liued in them, Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 7. ſo ſay I, ſpeaking in the good ſence; then doe we walke in Gods waies, when we liue in them. Whence we muſt note, that it is not a bare talking and diſcourſing about Gods wayes, that will ſerue turne, but a walking and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in them; not to know
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16458:17"/> them, but to doe them; not onely to be informed of them in our iudgements, nor onely conformed to them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, but transformed inwardly, by the renewing of our mindes, and reformed wholly in the practiſe of our liues.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, this ſpirituall walke hath relation, firſt, to God; ſecondly, to Man. Both muſt be regarded, and great heed muſt be taken how wee walke both before God and men: for there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, into which men commonly fall; the one is, ſo they haue a good heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God inwardly, (as they ſay) they neuer care how they ſeeme to their brethren; whereas the duties of pietie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in the firſt Table muſt ſhew themſelues in the duties of charity, and the light of an holy example to their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16458:17"/> brethren in the ſecond Table. The other is, ſo they can liue a ciuill honeſt life, and make a faire ſhew to the world, to blinde the eyes of men, they care not what they doe, nor how prophanely and lewdly they carry themſelues in the ſight and preſence of the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to walke with God, or to walke before God, is ſo to carry our ſelues, as in the ſight and preſence of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his all-ſeeing eye, diſcerning all our thoughts, words, and deedes, and admitting him to be the iuſt iudge of them all, and of the whole courſe of our liues: or, to walke before God, is to lead a holy and godly life, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to offend God in any thing, being fully perſwaded, that whereſoeuer, among whoſoeuer, or whatſoeuer doing, that God himſelfe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16458:18"/> ſtands by vs, beholding and obſeruing all our actions, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and thoughts, and will iudge them all. It is (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath it in the ſong of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie) to ſerue God without ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare, in holines &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before him all the daies of our life, Luke</hi> 1. 74. 75.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16458:19"/> of his good conſcience, out of which he appeales to God; for this was not any pride, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous conceit, that this good King had of himſelfe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any way to iuſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before God, but it was his peace of conſcience, <hi>which paſſeth all vnderſtanding:</hi> Hee knew well (that I may vſe the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) <hi>that he had liued in all good conſcience before God vntill this day, Acts 23. 1. and that he had exerciſed himſelfe to haue alwaies a conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence toward God and toward men, Acts 24. 16. His conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bearing him witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt, Rom. 9. 1.</hi> Out of this good conſcience, I ſay, he appealeth to God; ſaying, <hi>I beſeech thee O Lord, remember how I walked, &amp;c.</hi> A moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and worthy patterne of all, both high and low, to be followed, that wee may ſo

            <p>This continuall walking before God, to conſider that wee are alwaies in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, is, firſt, a ſpeciall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die againſt ſinne, and a mota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes to make vs liue in the feare of God. This kept <hi>Ioſeph</hi> from vncleaneneſſe, <hi>Gen. 39. 9. Iob</hi> from impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 18. The Mid-wiues from murther, <hi>Exod. 1.

            <p>The ſecond kinde of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is towards men: firſt, Publique; ſecondly, Priuate. Publique walking concernes, firſt, the members of the Church, and all beleeuers; ſecondly, thoſe which are out of the Church. <hi>Towards the firſt, we muſt walke in loue, peace, humility, meekeneſſe, &amp;c. Walke in loue, as Chriſt hath loued vs, Epheſ. 5. 1.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16458:21"/> liue ſo, giuing no iuſt cauſe of ſcandall &amp; offence, but ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good example to all men, in all things. <hi>We are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light, we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore walke as children of the light, Epheſ. 5. 8. Letting our light, of an holy example, ſo ſhine before others, that they may ſee our good workes, and glorifie God, Math. 5. 16.</hi> Towards the latter wee muſt walke, wiſely, honeſtly, no-offenſiuely; taking great heed to our waies, and hauing a ſpeciall care of our carriage, that in nothing wee giue any iuſt cauſe, either of exception or of offence, to the wicked and vnbelieuers. <hi>Walke wiſely towards thoſe which are without, redeeming the time, Coloſ. 4. 5.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16458:22"/> liue, and doe as they. To walke towards them, is meant to walke and liue amongſt them and as occaſion ſerues to haue any dealing with them; in all our carriage amongſt them, wee muſt doe all things to the glory of God and good of others. <hi>Wee muſt liue ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that wee may be blameleſſe and harmeleſſe, the Sonnes of God, without rebuke, in the middeſt of a crooked and peruerſe nation, among whom ſhine yee as lights in the world, Phil. 2. 15.</hi>

            <p>Now, the wayes of God which concerne vs, &amp; which we muſt walke, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two wayes; General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Specially. Generally; this way, is the way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, entring into the courſe of Chriſtian Religion, and profeſſing the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the doctrine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That this is called a way, appeareth in theſe places, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 9. when <hi>Paul</hi> was inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the doctrine of Chriſtian Religion, diſputing and perſwading things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kingdome of God, it is ſaid, <hi>Diuers ſpake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of that way. Saul</hi> the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter deſired to bring bound to Ieruſalem all that hee ſhould finde in this way, <hi>Act.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:16458:27"/> 9. 2. yea, hee perſecuted this way vnto the death, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 4. There aroſe no ſmall ſtirre about that way, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 23. So <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 22. In all theſe places is vnderſtood the way of Chriſtian Religion, and the profeſſion of the doctrine of the Goſpel, or ſome ſpeciall point thereof, as appeareth by the Context.</p>
            <p>The General way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is neceſſary vnto ſaluation, without it wee cannot come to heauen, and yet this alone being but a bare profeſſion cannot bring a man to heauen; This is the way of a number, euen of ſuch as goe for profeſſors, that yet for all this ſhall neuer come in heauen: <hi>Not euery one that ſaith vnto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen, Matth.</hi> 7. 21. that is, Not euery one that beares the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16458:28"/> name of a Chriſtian, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Name of Chriſt, and God to be his God, ſhall bee ſaued; not euery one that makes an outward ſhew of profeſſion, that can talke, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and diſcourſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and points of doctrine, though they may haue moſt excellent and rare gifts, ſhall bee ſaued: For many ſhall pleade for themſelues at the day of iudgement, ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord, haue wee not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out deuils? and in thy Name done many maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous workes, and then hee will profeſſe vnto them, hee neuer knew them: Depart from mee yee workers of iniquitie, Matt.</hi> 7. 22. There are many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the Church, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong profeſſors, who will make profeſſion of God with their mouthes, but denie him in the practiſe of their liues.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16458:28"/> 
               <hi>They profeſſe they know God, but by their workes they denie him, being abominable and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to euery good worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, Tit.</hi> 1. 16. Thus wee ſee, that though this be Gods way, which he commandeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. a good way in it ſelfe, yet not able to bring vs to heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Specially.</hi> The wayes of God wherein we muſt walke, may properly bee reduced to one head, for indeede there is but one way to heauen, which is called the way of life, the way of ſaluation; which, in a word, conſiſts in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe; holineſſe towards God, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe towards men. But becauſe their are many tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and many windings in this way; I meane, many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required, and many due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bee performed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16458:29"/> in the plurall number they are called Gods wayes, They walke in his wayes; I will reduce them all to three heads, vnder which all the reſt are comprehended.</p>
            <p>The firſt way, and the <note place="margin">The firſt way.</note> chiefe, is the way of Faith. This way went all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, and all beleeuers both in the Old and New Teſtament: A Catalogue of whom, and of their faith, is ſet downe at large in the whole Chapter, <hi>Heb. 11. For as we beleeue to be ſaued through the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſo did they, Act. 15. 11. By faith the Elders, and all thoſe beleeuers, through faith, obtained a good report. Heb.</hi> 11. 2, and 39. That this ſauing faith is our way to heauen, the Scriptures make it plaine: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wee walke by faith, not by ſight,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:16458:29"/> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. To walke by faith, is to liue by faith; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle explanes it, by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place out of <hi>Habacuk, The iuſt ſhall liue by faith, Heb.</hi> 10. 38. Thus did <hi>Paul: The life which I now liue in the fleſh, I liue by the faith of the Sonne of God, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. The whole life of a Chriſtian, both Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Temporall, in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and temptations, muſt be by faith; and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. that is whatſoeuer wee doe with a doubting conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is ſinne. Faith muſt both put a beginning to the work, and perſwade vs, that it is pleaſing to God. Secondly, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God in any thing, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. no not in the beſt things, as preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, and the like. No true preaching without faith;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16458:30"/> whether wee reſpect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Miniſter, who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, who muſt be faithfull; as Chriſt exhorts the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church of <hi>Smyrna, to bee faithfull to the death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 2. 10. or, whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the doctrine which hee teacheth, which muſt be the word of faith: <hi>This is the word of faith which wee preach vnto you Ro.</hi> 10. 8. So ſaith <hi>Paul, We beleeue, &amp; therfore ſpeak. 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 13. Againe, No true pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without faith; <hi>For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee aske, beleeuing, we ſhall obtaine, Mar.</hi> 11. 24. But hee that asketh without faith, is a wauering minded man, <hi>and ſhall obtaine nothing of the Lord, Iam.</hi> 1. 6, 7. Thus praying without faith, we aske, <hi>but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing, becauſe we aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, Iam.</hi> 4. 3. It muſt bee the prayer of faith, that muſt doe the deede, and preuaile with God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 15. Laſtly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16458:30"/> no profitable hearing the Word without faith: <hi>For the Goſpel was preached vnto them of old time, as it is now preached vnto vs, but it did not profit them, becauſe it was not mixt with faith in thoſe who heard it, Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Thirdly, wee muſt walke by faith, becauſe the things promiſed and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of vs, are inuiſible, and cannot bee beheld in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance; as, remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, iuſtification, the reſurrection and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; Therefore, <hi>faith is the ground of things hoped for, the euidence of things not ſeene, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. And thus in all the dueties of our generall and particular callings, wee muſt walke, that is, liue by faith; not to poſt off all doing of good vntill death, thinking to goe to heauen, with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord haue mercy vpon mee; but hee that will die in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16458:31"/> faith muſt liue in faith: No pleaſing of GOD without faith; No ſaluation without pleaſing of God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation without liuing by faith. To which faith, true repentance muſt bee ioyned, for one cannot goe without the other; faith muſt ſhewe it ſelfe in the fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and howſoeuer the beginnings of repentance are before faith, yet the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance it ſelfe, and the fruits of it follow faith.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way of God, <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way.</note> wherein we muſt walke, is the way of Gods Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And then are we ſaid to walke in this way, when we yeeld obedience vnto all Gods Commandements; Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right obedience, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, is walking in them. That the Commandements are a way, and obeying of

And the Lord will anouch vs to bee his peculiar people. Deut. 26. 17, 18.

It is hee that hath ordained good workes, that we ſhould walke in them, Epheſ. 2. 10. It is he which eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony in</hi> Iacob, <hi>and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a law in</hi> Iſraell, <hi>which he commanded our fore-fathers that they ſhould make them knowne to their children, &amp;c.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are all diuine and ſpirituall, and ſuch as pleaſe the Lord; diuine for the matter, which is Chriſt and his doctrine; <hi>for this way is Chriſt, as Iohn 14. 6. and no man commeth to the Father but by him;</hi> diuine for the manner; for, firſt, Chriſt is the firſt teacher of them: <hi>Thou tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt the way of God truely, Mat. 22. 16.</hi> and howſoeuer they were vttered and taught by his Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>yet theſe holy men ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt, 2 Pet. 1. 21.</hi> Thirdly, God is our onely true guide, who ordereth and directeth vs in this way; <hi>I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe; it is not in man that walketh to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his ſteps, Ier. 10. 23.

               <hi>God which teacheth vs in the way of wiſedome, and leadeth vs in the right pathes, Prou. 4. 11. A mans heart deuiſeth his way, but the Lord ordereth his ſteps, he directs them, Prou. 16. 9. Mans goings are of the Lord, how can a man then vnderſtand his owne way? Prou. 20. 24.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16458:38"/> to thoſe which are in Chriſt, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, Rom. 8. 1.</hi> The onely thing that commends vs vnto God, <hi>is walking in obedience to Gods commandements, 1 Cor. 7. 19. and to become new creatures, Gal. 6. 15. And as many as walke according to this rule, peace ſhall be vpon them, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iſraell of God, Gal. 6. 16.</hi> Neceſſary, <hi>for there are but two wayes, the narrow way, and broad way, and hee that walkes not in the narrow way, as I haue ſhewed, goes on headlong in the broad way, to his owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Math. 7. 13. 14.</hi> All the knowledge of this way is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without walking in it, and all our reading and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word to learne this way, is nothing, vnleſſe we walke in it. <hi>For better it is neuer to haue knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then after wee

And take heede that yee walke circumſpectly, becauſe the dayes are euill, Epheſ. 5. 15.</hi> If at any time wee erre from this way, and ſtep out of it, returne ſpeedily into it again, <hi>The iuſt man fals often, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againe, Prou. 24. 16.</hi> And
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16458:39"/> be ſure to perſeuere and hold on conſtant in this walke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end. <hi>The way of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is to depart from euill; hee that keepeth his way, preſerueth his ſoule, Prou. 16. 17. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe keepeth him that is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way, Prou. 13. 6. The righteous holdeth his way, Iob 23. 11.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeakes it in the future time, ſignifying perſeuerance; <hi>The waies of the Lord are right, and the iuſt ſhall walke in them, Hoſ. 14. 9.</hi> and ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>They walke,</hi> that is, they continue walking, liuing all their daies without fainting) <hi>in Gods waies.</hi>

The ſecond is taken from the example of Chriſt, teaching vs to imitate him in his loue; for, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of wrongs is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſily obtained, nor of any account in Gods ſight, vnleſſe it proceeds from loue, therefore hee ioynes this to the former, <hi>And walke in loue, as Chriſt hath loued vs. Verſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes by way of Dehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſſwading them from three moſt pernitious vices, and hainous ſinnes, <hi>viz.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16458:41"/> all Vncleanneſſe, and Couetouſneſſe, which were either not acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bee ſinnes at all, or at leaſt much extenuated or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; as alſo from three ſinnes of the tongue, <hi>viz.</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, fooliſh talking, and ieſting; all which hee dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from, by foure moſt weighty reaſons. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>they become not Saints, Verſ.</hi> 3. Secondly, becauſe <hi>they are not conuenient, Verſ.</hi> 4. Thirdly, becauſe <hi>they exclude vs out of Gods Kingdome, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 5. Fourthly, becauſe <hi>for ſuch things ſake, the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of diſobedience, Verſe</hi> 6. And whereas many are ready to obiect, and ſay, that they are no ſinnes at all, or at leaſt not ſo hainous as they are made, neither is there any ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in them, as is ſet downe by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the aforeſaid
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16458:42"/> reaſons; He therefore giueth vs an <hi>Item,</hi> and a ſpeciall <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat,</hi> teaching vs, that all ſuch obiections and allegations, contrary to his doctrine, are but idle and vaine ſpeeches, whereby men goe about to deceiue and ſeduce vs; and ſo ſhall all finde that truſt to them; <hi>Let no man therefore deceiue you with vaine words;</hi> for moſt certainely, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy wrath of God ſhall fall vpon them that commit ſuch ſinnes: <hi>Bee not yee therefore companions with ſuch, as ye would be loth to partake of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Verſ.</hi> 6, 7. Thirdly, he ſets downe a generall exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the well-ordering of our liues; that is, not to liue any longer in the former darkeneſſe of our ſinnes, but to walke as children of the light; drawing his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the diuerſitie of their eſtate, partly from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16458:42"/> their eſtate before conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Yee were once darkeneſſe;</hi> partly from their eſtate after conuerſion; <hi>but now yee are light in the Lord: walke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as children of the light. ver.</hi> 8. that is, liue, and leade the whole courſe of your liues an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to your new eſtate &amp; condition wherunto ye are called; for euen your calling out of the ſtate of darkeneſſe vnto light, requires it. <hi>Hoc tempus alios mores poſtulat,</hi> This time requires another manner of life than before, when you were in darkneſſe. And, whereas it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded how we ſhould ſo liue, and wherein this walke conſiſteth? the Apoſtle ſheweth plainely, that this walke conſiſts of three ſteps, 1. <hi>to prooue, or approoue what is pleaſing to the Lord,</hi> that ſo wee may compoſe and frame our liues according to Gods will,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16458:43"/>

He that marks not both what goes before, &amp; what followes after his text, peruerts the order of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> Now to the Text.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, I obſerue, that <note place="margin">1. Obſer.</note> it is the dutie of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in generall, and each one in particular, diligently to ſearch, prooue, and try, what is the will of God; and this in the firſt place. It is not ſufficient to know, that there is a way, but to know which is the right, ſtreight, and true way; So it is not enough to know that Gods will muſt be fulfilled, but to know what that will is, which God will haue vs to obey; Therefore, as a traueller, not well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way, makes inquirie vpon all occaſions, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out the beſt way, and getteth all the beſt directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee can to bring him the

Almighty

Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge, is when we ſo know his will, as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it in our liues; to know by experience, what is Gods will; and this is ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <hi>for he onely that doth the will of God, ſhall be ſaued, Math.</hi> 7. 21.

And the more we are exerciſed in obedience to Gods will, the more liuely doe wee perceiue,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16458:55"/> and know, what is pleaſing and acceptable to God. The ſimple knowledge which we haue by the word goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but this experimentall knowledge followes after, and perfects the former.

Thus Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to haue learned</hi> (id eſt, <hi>experimentally) obedience, by the things which he ſuffered, Heb.</hi> 5. 8. and of this ſpeaketh Chriſt, <hi>Reuel. 2. 17.

                  <p>Now this doing of Gods <note place="margin">Doing of Gods will two-fold.</note> will is two-fold. Legall and perfect: Euangelicall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. The firſt, is to doe Gods will ſo as the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, in a moſt perfect and abſolute manner, according to the rigour, exaction, and ſtrict order preſcribed in the Law, without the leaſt breach of any part of any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, either in thought word or deede. This abſolute fulfilling of Gods will, in this life, ſince the fall of man, none (Chriſt alone excepted) euer did, or can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to in this life, but in the kingdome of glory all Gods children ſhall perfectly both know and doe it: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16458:56"/> is ſuch a kinde of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the Goſpell requires, that is to ſay; It is an vpright and ſincere endeauour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſtriue to the vttermoſt of our power, by vſing all good meanes, to doe that which is pleaſing to God, and to auoid that which is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his ſight. This wee may and muſt attaine vnto in this life, and that betimes; but this is imperfect in the beſt in this world; and yet God accepts of it in Chriſt; and the imperfections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are neuer imputed to Gods children, but the perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt is imputed vnto vs, and ſo in Chriſt and through him, God accepts of our imperfect obedience, and beholds vs in him, as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and perfect before him. Yea, in all Gods children, where God ſees this holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour, ſtriuing againſt ſin
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16458:56"/> and weakeneſſe, and that wee are heartily ſorry, that we can doe it no better, God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy accepts the will for the deede. <hi>For if there be firſt a willing minde, it is accepted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that a man hath, and not according to that hee hath not, 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 12. And this is our comfort in diſtreſſe of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>But here, let it be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; that thoſe forenamed words of the Apoſtle, are moſt groſſely abuſed of a number, to licentiouſneſſe of liuing, preſuming and taking libertie to ſinne as they liſt; thinking that God will hold them excuſed, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and good meanings, and that God will accept of them for their good deſires, for they loue God in their hearts, and haue a deſire and will to pleaſe him, though they liue in their ſinnes: All
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16458:57"/> ſuch doe fouly deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; for the Apoſtle ſpeakes not ſimply of bare deſires, and a meere will, but of ſuch a willing minde, as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours ſincerely, to forſake all ſinnes, and which vſeth all good meanes to come to faith and repentance, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth ſo doing; then, though frailty may faile grace for a time, and we obey but weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet God will accept of vs for our vpright endeauour, which ſhall be well pleaſing in his ſight. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place, Verſe 11. <hi>Now performe the doing of of it, that as there was a read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For our better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this point, I will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it; firſt, <hi>Generally;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what that is, in generall, which is acceptable or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Lord; ſecondly, more <hi>particularly;</hi> what the pleaſure and will of God is, and wherein it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Generally,</hi> that is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or pleaſing to God, which is agreeable to the will of God; this, and onely this, is well-pleaſing to the Lord;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16458:82"/> therefore the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs to proue what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Lord, explaines himſelfe afterwards, ſpeaking of the ſame thing, in the 17. Verſe, <hi>be not vnwiſe, but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the will of the Lord is.</hi> Thus to pleaſe God, and in all things to obey Gods will, are all one, and often taken for the ſame in Scriptures. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 Epiſt. 3. 22. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer wee aske, wee receiue of God, becauſe we doe thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> Which hee explaines after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpeaking of the ſame thing; <hi>This is the confidence that we haue in him, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 14. And ſo the Apoſtle in his prayer, ſheweth, ſaying, <hi>The God of peace make you perfect in euery good worke, to doe his will, working in you that which is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in his ſight, Heb.</hi> 13. 21.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16458:82"/> where he giueth vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that a good worke and well-pleaſing to the Lord is that which is done according to his will, and which hee worketh by his ſpirit in his children. And ſo, on the contrary, that is diſpleaſing to the Lord, which is diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and contrary vnto the will of God; When they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt God, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they had nothing but <hi>Manna,</hi> they forgat God and were vnthankefull, this was contrary vnto Gods will; <hi>and this diſpleaſed the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 78. at large. <hi>Yea, forty yeares long was God grieued with this generation, Pſal. 95. 10. and they pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. becauſe they did ſuch things as were not according to the will of God, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto it, <hi>as, they killed the Lord Ieſus, and their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:16458:83"/> 
                  <hi>and perſecuted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the like.</hi> Secondly, then wee are ſaid to doe that which is well-pleaſing to the Lord, or acceptable to the Lord, when we labour in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of he art to keepe Gods commandements; as on the contrarie we doe as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſe God, when wee breake his commandements. <hi>Whatſoeuer we aske of God, wee receiue, becauſe wee keepe his commandements, and doe thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight, 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 22. where wee may ſe, that, to keepe Gods commandements, and to doe what is pleaſing in his ſight, are in effect all one; and wee can not poſſibly pleaſe God in any thing, vnleſſe woe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to yeeld vpright o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and when no outward action, priuiledge, or prerogatiue whether of Iew

                  </label> Hence I gather, that the right way to pleaſe God, is to doe nothing but what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Gods will, ioyned with obedience to all Gods commandements. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know when it is agreeable to Gods will, and when it is not? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is onely then agreeable to Gods will, when it is agreable to the word of God; for his whole will is contained in the word, and when wee doe what the word commands, and leaue vndone what the word forbids, then we doe the will of God, and pleaſe him; and when wee doe contrary vnto the word, we vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him. Now the will of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16458:84"/> God is two-fold: Secret, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed. The firſt is the will of his good pleaſure, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may nor can be reſiſted, <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe al my pleaſure, &amp;c. Iſay.</hi> 46. 10. 11.

He hath predeſtinated vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5. and the like. This ſecret will, being the will of his good pleaſure, is not here meant, neither doth this belong to vs to pry into, neither is this the rule of our actions. <hi>Secrets belong to God, Deut.</hi> 29. 29. But I ſpeake of the reuealed will of God, which is called his ſignified will, which is reuealed and made knowne to vs in his ſacred word; <hi>Reuealed things belong to vs, Deut.</hi> 29. 29. And this is the only law and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16458:84"/> Rule of all our actions, yea, of whatſoeuer is to bee either beleeued or practiſed; Thus the Word is the will of God; both the Law and Goſpel, becauſe they ſerue to declare, and manifeſt vnto vs, what is pleaſing and acceptable to God, and what is our duety both towards God, our ſelues, and others, thus commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, counſels, commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, threatnings, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, promiſes, and the like, are the ſignifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed will of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which onely, wee muſt thinke, ſpeake, and doe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Particularly:</hi> I come to ſhew from the word of God, what this Reuealed will of God is, and the ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, wherein it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16458:88"/> A point, I muſt confeſſe, of great moment, as any in the whole Scripture, and yet as little knowne, and leſſe practiſed; for let a man aske ſome, What is the onely thing to bee looked after? Happily ſome wil ſay, though very few, that the chiefe thing is to liue according to Gods will, to ſerue and pleaſe God; this is all they can ſay, not knowing what it is, or how, to ſerue and pleaſe God. Some goe further, and by wrote they ſay, God muſt be ſerued according to his will in his Word, and this is all: But aske them, what the Word reuealeth, concerning Gods will, and what this will is, wherein it conſiſteth, and the like, and they can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; A ſtrange thing, that this queſtion, What is the will of God reuealed in his Word, ſhould ſet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16458:88"/> part of the world, at <hi>Non plus.</hi> And becauſe it is of ſuch great moment, and a maine point of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I haue therefore ſet it downe particularly, from the word of God, what is the pleaſure and will of God, and wherein it conſiſteth; that ſo thoſe which haue not knowne, may be inlightned in their vnderſtanding, and informed in their iudgments, &amp; they which haue knowne, may bee more and more ſtrengthened, and bee ſtirred to a further increaſe in proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and doing what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Lord; which, though I might handle at large, yet I haue reduced all to theſe fewe heads, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>Firſt of the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reuealed wil of God in his Word, is this; That
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16458:89"/> we ſhould liue by faith in the Sonne of God; beleeuing in him with all our hearts, and dayly repenting vs of all our ſinnes; leading an holy and ſahctified life; continually performing both actiue and paſſiue obedience, to all Gods Commandements; growing, and increaſing daily in grace and godlines, This in effect, is all that the Word of God reuealeth; and no part of it, but aymes at one of theſe; all which may bee reduced to theſe three heads: 1. Faith. 2. Repentance: 3. New obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; in all which the will of God conſiſteth. This <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth, when he ſaid to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus: Yee know how I kept backe nothing</hi> (namely of the reuealed will of God) <hi>that was profitable vnto you, but haue ſhewed you and taught you publiquely, and from houſe to houſe, teſtifying
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16458:89"/> both to the Iewes, and alſo to the Greekes, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Acts</hi> 20. 20. 21. In which place, wee may plainely obſerue, that the ſumme of all the doctrine of the Bible is, that men ſhould come to Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which two things <hi>Paul</hi> teaching, (ioyned with New obedience) hee is ſaid to haue kept backe nothing of the will of God, profitable for them. And thus came Ieſus preaching the Goſpel of the kingdome of God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Repent, and beleeue the Goſpel, Mark.</hi> 1. 14, 15. all his preaching ayming at this, to bring men to faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for indeede, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things needfull to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be reduced to theſe two; and all other graces of the Spirit neceſſary for Gods children, will accompany
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16458:90"/> theſe in whomſoeuer they are truely wrought.</p>
               <p>But for the better clearing of this point, and for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explaining of this reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of GOD, I reduce them to ſeuen heads: in which this will of God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. 1. In Beleeuing. 2. In Repenting. 3. In Holineſſe and Sanctification of life. 4. In Well-doing. 5. in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for well-doing. 6. In Generall obedience. 7. In increaſe and growth of grace. All which I ſhew from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, proouing what is pleaſing to the Lord, as being an expoſition, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Definition.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The will of God conſiſteth in <hi>Beleeuing.</hi> As our Sauiour himſelfe ſaith, <hi>This is the will of him that ſent mee, that euery one which ſeeth the Sonne</hi> (that is, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16458:90"/> him to bee the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as) <hi>and beleeueth on him, may haue euerlaſting life. Iohn</hi> 6. 40. To beleeue in Chriſt is not onely to haue a generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Gods mercie, but to apply Chriſt vpon found ground to bee my and thy Sauiour in particular; and not onely that the promiſes of the Goſpel are true in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but that they belong to me and thee in particular. This Application is the main thing in ſauing faith, without which, Knowledge, Aſſent. Approbation, profeſſion, and Confeſſion of Chriſt are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And that euery one may the better conceiue of it, and perceiue it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee muſt trie it by this; <hi>It purifieth the heart.</hi> Acts. 15. 9. <hi>It makes a man to become like to God in purity, to purge himſelfe as God is pure.</hi> Iohn 3. 3. <hi>It will not ſuffer a man to</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:16458:91"/> 
                  <hi>liue in the darkeneſſe of his old ſinnes; for Chriſt came a light into the world, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in darkeneſſe.</hi> Ioh. 12. 46. Thus by beleeuing wee doe the will of God; but he that wanteth theſe things, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as bad as euer hee was, wanteth ſauing faith, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approoue what is the wil of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The will of GOD conſiſts in <hi>Repenting:</hi> which appeares in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Haue I any pleaſure at all, that the wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord God? And not that he ſhould returne from his waies, and liue? Ezech.</hi> 18. 23. As if God had ſaid, I haue no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of a ſinner, but my pleaſure is, that hee repent and liue; and ſo the Prophet explaines afterwards, ſaying, <hi>As I liue, ſaith the</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:16458:91"/> 
                  <hi>Lord, I haue no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, and liue; Turne yee, turne yee from your euill wayes, for why will yee die, O houſe of Iſrael? Ezeeh.</hi> 33. 11. Thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, is to doe the will of God; yet not euery repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>Iudas repented, but it was but a worldly ſorrow, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of puniſhment, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth death. 2. Corinth.</hi> 7. 10. But true repentance is a turning from all our ſinnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning vnto God, as in the former words of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> It is the through-change of the heart, minde, will, and affections, and an alteration of the whole life of man, from euill to good, ioyned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with a purpoſe of not ſinning; This is, <hi>to caſt off e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery tranſgreſſion, whereby wee haue tranſgreſſed, and to make vs a new heart, and a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>

It conſiſteth in two things; the one is, the the depoſition, or putting off the old man; the other is, the induition, or putting on the new man; both are two-fold; firſt, the putting off the old man of ſinne; and the putting on of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; this is begun in this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16458:129"/> life, and perfected after death; of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 22. 23. 24. That yee put off, concerning the former conuerſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull luſts; and be renewed in the ſpirit of your minde; and that yee put on that new man, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly the putting off the old man of mortality and the aſſuming or putting on immortality, and that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous reſurrection to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. This wee are with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to hope and waite for; of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh at large, in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſowne corruptible, &amp;c. And as we haue borne the image of the earthy, ſo ſhall wee beare the image of the heauenly.</hi> But in the Doctrine of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the former is properly meant. 2 The patterne of this grace, that is, Chriſt his righteouſneſſe and holineſſe;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16458:129"/> this is the very <hi>idea</hi> of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and celeſtiall natiuity; in him it was moſt abſolute and perfect; but in vs, in this life moſt imperfect; Thus, as Chriſt died, and roſe againe for vs, <hi>ſo wee ſhould die vnto ſinne, and riſe againe to newneſſe of life, Rom. 6. Euery regenerate man will purge himſelfe euen as Chriſt is pure, 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 3. as, in quality and conformity, but not as, in equality. There is a corruption of nature, the one which is ſinne the other is the puniſhment of ſinne; The puniſhment of ſinne, Chriſt had, as infirmity of the fleſh, imbecillity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and death; this hee put off by his death, and put on the new, <hi>viz.</hi> glory of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality in his reſurrection; but we muſt put off both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature; Wee muſt alwaies haue our eyes bent vpon Chriſt, and labour to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16458:130"/> faction, here in this world, life is either loſt, or kept, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; If then there be no place of repentance after this life, then none for regeneration; for what is repentance, but the change and renouation of the minde? To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Worke while it is day, the night commeth, when no man can worke, Iohn 12. 35. and 9. 4.

                  <hi>Haue no fellowſhip, &amp;c.</hi> Now I come to handle theſe words more particularly, and to ſhew, how many wares a man may bee ſaid to haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to communicate with the ſinnes of others
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16458:161"/> called here works of darknes. And wee muſt know, that euill workes are of two ſorts. 1. Such as are common to all ſorts. 2. Such as are more proper to this or that ſort, degree or calling. The firſt are two-fold. 1. Such as goe before the thing to bee committed. 2. Such as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after the ſinne is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Before, a man may bee ſaid to communicate, and to haue felowſhip, and to bee acceſſary to the ſinnes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, diuers wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>by prouocation;</hi> as when one ſhall prouoke another vnto ſinne, though hee that is pouoked, is guilty of the act of ſinning, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſin perſonally, yet he who prouoked him to that ſinne, is guilty alſo, as being acceſſary to his brothers ſin, and hee hath fellowſhip with
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16458:162"/> him in his ſinne, and it is as much as if hee had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſinne in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both in regard of the ſinne it ſelfe, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due vnto that ſinne. This prouoking of others to ſinne, may bee done two wayes. 1. By incenſing, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ſtirring vp, or compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling men to ſinne. 2. by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing, or alluring others vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne: and both theſe may be done two wayes. 1. By word, 2. By deede: when a man either by word or deed, ſhall excite, ſtirre vp, and draw on others to euill, as vniuſt anger, wrath, reuenge, hatred, diſcontentment, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, drunkenneſſe, whoredome, and the like. Firſt, I ſay, men prouoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſinne by incenſing, or ſtirring them vp to ſinne; as <hi>Iezebel</hi> did <hi>Ahab,</hi> killing <hi>Naboth</hi> for his vineyard:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16458:162"/> 
                  <hi>There was none like vnto</hi> Ahab, <hi>who ſold himſelfe to worke wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord; whom</hi> Iezebel <hi>his wife ſtirred vp, 1. King.</hi> 21. 25. Thus did wicked <hi>Amnon rauiſh his ſiſter Tamar; for hee being ſtronger than ſhee, forced her, and lay with her. 2. Sam.</hi> 13. 14. This is a ſinne in many parents, forbidden by Saint <hi>Paul, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; prouoke not your children to wrath, leaſt they bee diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 21. Now pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may be ſaid to prouoke their children to wrath, three wayes. 1. <hi>by vniuſt, wicked, and vnreaſonable commands. 2. By contumelious words, rating, and reuiling them, and miſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them. 3. By extreame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity, and rigorous dealing, in their ſtriking and beating of them exceſſiuely in their mad moode, and rage, without all reaſon.</hi> It was the ſinne of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt his ſonne <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:16458:163"/> Firſt, <hi>he commanded him to bring vnto him innocent</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, <hi>that he might kill him.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>hee miſcalled him, and reuiled him, calling him the Sonne of a peruerſe, rebellious woman.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>he caſt a iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin at him, to ſmite him, with purpoſe to kill him; thus</hi> Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>aroſe from the Table in fierce anger, &amp;c. 1 Sam.</hi> 20. from Verſe 30. to the end of 33. But moſt common is this ſinne amongſt drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, and ſuch as delight in drunken fellowſhip, who ſtirre vp, and compell men to be drunke, or elſe will offer violence to their perſons, whereupon it comes to paſſe, that many not onely hazard, but looſe their liues in this caſe.</p>

Thirdly, in regard of our goods and outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; for either it hindereth, from receiuing good at Gods hand; or elſe cauſeth a curſe vpon them being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; either outward things ſhall not goe well with vs, or they ſhall bee as ſnares vnto vs, heaping vp wrath againſt the day of wrath. <hi>Your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue ſeparated betweene you, and your God; and your ſinnes haue hid his face from you, that he will not heare, &amp;c.

Malac. 2, 2. &amp;c.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In regard of our good name; Sinne brings vpon vs nothing but bad report, ſhame, diſgrace, reproach, yea, ſuch as wil neuer be done away. <hi>Hee that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh vnderſtanding; hee that doth it, deſtroyeth his owne ſoule; A wound and diſhonour ſhall hee get, and his reproach ſhall not bee wiped away. Prou. 6. 33. A wicked man is loathſome, and commeth to ſhame. Prou. 13. 5. What fruit had yee then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Rom.</hi> 6. 21.

               <p>In a word; Sinne is vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in regard of others: For hereby wee doe greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the weake brethren, Icandalize the Church, and harden the wicked in their ſinnes, and confirme them in their wickedneſſe; By ſinne, wee lay a ſtumbling blocke in the way, and cauſe others to fall; <hi>A violent man entiſeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. Pro. 16. 29. Wicked men ſleepe not, except they haue done miſchiefe, and their ſleepe is taken away, vnleſſe they cauſe ſome to fall. Prou.</hi> 4. 16. How vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnfruitfull all theſe wayes are, appeareth. <hi>For he that offendeth one of the litle ones that beleeue in Chriſt, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, and that hee were drowned in the depth of the ſea.

               <p>Hence then I gather, that <note place="margin">Obſer.</note> the maine thing to be aymed at in our reproofes, is Sinne in man, not ſo much man himſelfe; it is Sinne that is the bane of the ſoule; ſinne is mortall, deadly, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Through ſinne, both ſoule and body periſh, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not repented of; Seeing then we muſt labour to gaine our brother from periſhing in

Let vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this in the example of <hi>Cain: The Lord reprooued him for his wrath, and ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> (which were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of further miſchiefe) <hi>but hee not regarding the Lords reproofe for thoſe ſmaller ſinnes, grew to the height of that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and crying ſinne of murther; riſing, vp againſt his innocent brother</hi> Abel, <hi>ſlew him.

Thus a number beeing reproued for their luſts, chambering, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wantonneſſe, laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and not regarding
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:16458:237"/> it, grow to whoredome: So when men are reprooued for haunting bad places, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping bad company, and not yeeld vnto it, come at length to that horrible ſinne of drunkenneſſe, theft, and the like.</p>
